                What started out as a dream hatched over a cup of coffee and a homemade
                cake, and turned into a reality when Catawba Coffee came to be in 2014.
                When Irene, the owner, came to Mount Holly it was originally for her to
                manage another independent shop. As time went by she met some of the
                most wonderful people! Many who knew each other and some who just
                happened by (mostly by accident) no matter how you got here or where you
                came from you'll become a regular. There's always the most eclectic
                group of folks sitting around and telling stories, all over a cup of
                coffee.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    When the opportunity came to Irene and her husband Joe to buy the shop
                    it was nearly an immediate yes. The fear and doubt were quickly pushed
                    aside when the thought of having to leave Mount Holly and the family
                    that they'd became a part of was no longer imminent. Often times they're
                    asked how they came up with the name of their shop and the answer is and
                    will always be the Catawba River. Needless to say, the challenge of
                    being business owners was accepted and they have never looked back.
                </p>
                <br />
                So, If you're in the area be sure to stop by for a cup and a smile. We'd
                love to meet you!

            <p>"This place has their own roaster who roasts a proprietary blend just for their business! In a word, all
                of their coffee is phenomenal ! The atmosphere is relaxing and I jokingly say my office is in the
                corner on the right. I spend so much time there people actually get up and move if I enter the shop. If
                you want to know what Mount Holly is really like, this is the place to come. All educational, economic,
                religious, social groups come here and blend together! It's more than coffee...it is a place you can
                say
                is more like home, than home!"</p>
